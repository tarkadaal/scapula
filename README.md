## TODO

- setup rPi image
- install prerequisites on rPi
- build scapula_web
  - Web front end to allow anonymous users to upload video files
  - Files are stored on local configurable storage
- build scapula_player
  - Daemon to play videos from storage to screen

Other media types would be good (messages, pictures), but that's MVP

## Prerequisites (so far)

... I was going to make a list, but so far, it's what's on [here](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation) 
(except Postgres - I don't think a database is going to be needed)
